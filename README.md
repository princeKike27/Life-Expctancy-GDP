# Life-Expectancy-GDP

For this project I analyzed data on Growth Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries. GDP is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. Being a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country's economic health.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

    Data cleaning and standardization.
    Analysis of Life Expectancy and GDP from 2000 to 2015.
    Correlation Analysis of Life Expectancy and GDP.
